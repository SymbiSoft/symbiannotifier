#labels Phase-Implementation
If you want to give it a try to the app in the development stage.

The app starts with the file *notifier.py* that file uses and execfile function because otherwise he can't see other python files, so import doesn't work even if the file to import is in the same directory. 

So if you see execfile, it has the path to the python shell examples, so maybe you have it in the unit C:, in case you have it in E you do not need to do anything.
